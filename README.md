Project: Factory Downtime Analysis – Deloitte Data Analytics Simulation

This project is part of a Deloitte Data Analytics job simulation. The task was to analyze telemetry data from four Daikibo factories using **Tableau** and identify which factory had the most machine downtime.

🔍 Objective:

* Analyze machine health data to find where machines broke down the most.
* Identify which types of machines were most affected in that factory.

 🧰 Tools Used:

* Tableau
* JSON data file

📊 Key Findings:

* **Daikibo Factory Seiko** (Osaka, Japan) had the **highest total downtime**.
* Specific machine types in Seiko contributed significantly to overall disruption.

📌 Deliverables:

* Calculated a downtime measure using unhealthy machine status
* Created two interactive bar charts:

  * **Down Time per Factory**
  * **Down Time per Device Type**
* Built a dashboard with filter functionality to drill into factory-level insights

✅ Conclusions & Key Findings:

🏭 Seiko Factory in Osaka had the highest machine downtime.
🔧 Certain machine types caused repeated “unhealthy” alerts.
📊 Dashboard helped visualize and filter key problem areas.
✅ Insights support better maintenance and reduced delays.
